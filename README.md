# Talk With Groot

If you have any problems, it is always recommended that you talk to someone, but I recommend talking to the **Groot**.

The first step is adding the gem in your Gemafile

```
gem "talk_with_groot"
```

Use the package manager `bundle` to install hi_world.

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'talk_with_groot'

puts TalkWithGroot.es
```

## Parameters

You can choose a language for talking with **Groot**
